# ModalConsistencyChecker

Welcome!

This program checks whether a set of formulas are consistent in S5 Propositional Modal Logic. 

A more user-friendly interface for the program is at my website: http://briantackett.pythonanywhere.com/  Instructions, examples, and background information on modal logic are posted there.

tests.py contains the current test cases used each time an update is being made.  If you want to test a lot of cases at once, you can copy that file, add your cases, and run it.  Make sure the formulas are already in Polish notation.

weblogic.py contains all of the functions used in the program.
